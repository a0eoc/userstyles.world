# Kind Content guidelines

Last updated August 7, 2021

We'd like to clarify that these guidelines are only effective on the
UserStyles.world website.


## Purpose

UserStyles.world("USw") encourages their users from anyone who wishes to
add/import/review/explore UserCSS styles("styles"), to be able to do so.
People shouldn't feel discouraged from participating in this community.

In order to ensure the safety and quality of styles, we encourage anyone
to make a conscious effort into following these guidelines
to the best of their ability.

We'd like to note and clarify that actions[ยน](#footnote) will be taken
to ensure the safety and quality of content on the USw platform.

These guidelines suggest specific ways to accomplish that goal.


## Guidelines

- As a platform that hosts UserCSS styles, USw highly discourages to host/post
  other content then UserCSS styles.

- USw allows hosting screenshot(s) of your style(s), please use this screenshot
  to show what your style looks like when it's installed.

- As noted, USw hosts screenshot(s) for their styles, please remember that not
  everyone is of consent age in their respective country, therefore we
  discourage the usage of not safe for work ("NSFW") images for these
  screenshot(s).

- When you're writing a review of a style, please give constructive feedback,
  which will help the author improve the style. USw discourages writing reviews
  that are based on feedback which doesn't help the author improve the style.
    
- Please remember that you don't have to write a review if you don't want to.

- Please recognize that criticism/feedback of your styles is not a personal
  attack on you.

- Please don't raise unrelated topics/off-topic while writing a style review.

- Please don't use the review/feedback system to report bugs. While these help
  the author, this system is not the correct way to report them. Try to contact
  the author directly and/or check for a support URL in the UserCSS style.

- Please don't upload styles that discriminate against certain group or groups
  of people.

- Please don't try to post other people's work, but if you do, ensure that the
  license of the original work allows this. USw highly discourages posting other
  people's work if their license is not permissive of it. Also, please try to
  give credit to the original author.


## Footnote

1. To clarify "actions", we say that trusted users and admins have the ability
   to remove styles/users if they heavily and/or repeatedly violate these
   guidelines. This is to accomplish the goal explained in [Purpose](#purpose).
   This is how UserStyles.world tries to enforce these guidelines.
