# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The supported version is easily defined, whatever current version the server(https://userstyles.world) is using.
This can be seen in the footer whereby the specific git commit + version is specified.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you'd find a security vulnerability, you can report it to [security@userstyles.world](mailto:security@userstyles.world).  

If you'd like, you can GPG encrypt the message via the UserStyles.world's public key which can be found at: https://userstyles.world/security.gpg.
